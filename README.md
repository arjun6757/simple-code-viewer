## Description
I'm working on a code-viewer that allows users to:
1. Fetch their pinned Github repositories (ready)
2. View the code from these repositories with syntax highlighting (ready)
3. See a live demo of the associated website (if available) (ready but not great)
4. Navigate between pinned repos with just few clicks (ready but with only one click)
